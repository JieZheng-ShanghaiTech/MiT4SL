# MiT4SL
MiT4SL is the first machine learning model for cross cell line prediction of synthetic lethal (SL) gene pairs. It uses a novel architecture of triplet representation learning for (1) gene features based on a knowledge graph and protein sequences, and (2) cell line information by integrating multi-omics data of gene expression, PPI network and protein sequences.
